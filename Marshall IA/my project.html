                    We took on the challenge of duplicating the computer science department website of the University of Ghana Legon as given to us by our web design lecturer for an interim assessment. Every student had to create and complete ten pages, combining their academic knowledge with real-world web design skills. focusing on attention to detail, design concepts, and accurate replication of the current web platform, the goal was to demonstrate creativity, knowledge of technology, and awareness of user experience. In addition to fulfilling the objectives, the project aimed to improve the department's online image by showcasing skill and the use of web design principles. </p>
